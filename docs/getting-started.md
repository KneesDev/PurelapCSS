# Getting Started
Purelap is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with sites.

## Installation
To use PurelapCSS in your HTML project, you need to link the CSS file in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/purelap/purelap.min.css">
```

In the code above, we're linking the latest version of Purelap from jsDelivr. You can use a specific version of the framework by adding the version after `purelap` using `@`.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/purelap@1.0.0/purelap.min.css">
```

# Wrapping Up
That's it! You're now ready to start using PurelapCSS in your projects. Head over to the [Components Library](Components-Library) to see all the available components and start using them.
